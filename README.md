# Notes on the code
This is code from the learning from the CS50 Web Programming, and TAU's Introduction to Playwright courses.

## Playwright
- AAA pattern: This is a pattern that suggests structuring our code in sections.
- The first section is the Arrange section. The second is Act, and the third is Assert.
- Ideally, all the variables should come at the very beginning of a file or a method.
